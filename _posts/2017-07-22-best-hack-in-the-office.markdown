We have whiteboards at the office, and like an idiot I found a marker (thought it was a whiteboard marker) and used it on the whiteboard and later realized that it was a permanent marker! I was not sure how to fix it so I went to the obvious place (Google of course!) and searched for this. Turns out I wasn't the only one, well I wasn't very surprised by that, but the most astonishing fact was the answer!

Simply put, _fight fire with fire. _That's it! Use a **whiteboard marker** to erase the permanent marker! What an unbelievable solution! Best office hack.
