### **Plot**


Hana is a 19 year old student who also works part-time at the laundry to pay her tuition fees. She meets a boy in her class, who is not a student formally but attends classes. He works part-time as a mover. They fall in love, and the boy shows Hana his deepest secret; that he is a descendant of the Japanese Wolves who have been extinct for about a hundred years. They start living together, and eventually have children—the first, a baby girl named Yuki and then a son named Ame. Their happy life is interrupted by the death of the wolf man, their father. Hana is faced with extreme hardships managing their two kids, and doing other chores in the household alone. Ame and Yuki can also transform into wolves like their father. As a result, Hana decides to move to the countryside so they can live their lives in secrecy...


### **My Review**


If they gave Oscars for anime, I think this would be a rightful nominee. Anime is so lovable because of many reasons. The one with the greatest consequence in my opinion is that it portrays deep emotion. Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki brings out that in abundance. There are times when everybody is as happy as they can get, and sometimes it can bring you to tears. I had a wonderful time watching it.

**Story**: This has one of the best story that I have ever come across. I love the slice of life genre and I thoroughly enjoyed the two hours that I spent on this movie. For the amazing idea and plot, I give it a 10/10.

**Art**: The art is excellent as well, the characters are drawn very well. The scenery is also looks great. Only thing is that the waterfall looks a bit off, so I will give this a 9/10.

**Characters**: Again, amazing character design, I totally loved the main characters. Hana is my favourite, as she is sentimental, sympathetic, responsible, and would go to any length to protect her kids. The characters of Ame and Yuki are brought out very well. So this gets 10/10.

**Overall Rating**: 10/10
