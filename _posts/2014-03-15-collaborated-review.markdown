Hello,

I love reviewing anime, and I was thinking of trying something new. I got inspired by a reviewer on YouTube who reviews with a couple of his friends. The outcome of their review is great!

I find debates being more entertaining to watch than just monologue, and the discussion will have many different view points. But most importantly, it will be tonnes of fun!

Alright, I'll run you through what's going to happen. Reviewers come online on Skype, we group chat and record the conversation while we discuss. Later, we do some editing and publish the review. Simple enough, right?

Do not worry about the technicalities, we can make it work some way or the other. It is only a matter of interest.

So... Are you game?
