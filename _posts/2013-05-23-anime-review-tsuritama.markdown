**Plot**

Sanada Yuki is an ordinary student. His parents are unfortunately no more, and he lives with his grandmother. Yuki does not have many friends, because he moves with his grandmother from one place to another often and as a result ends up going to different schools. Whenever he gives a self-introduction in front of the class, he breaks down under the pressure of all the students watching him. He starts sweating profusely and the tension on his face makes him look like a devil, and hence he is dubbed 'Devil Face' by his classmates. Yuki has a feeling of emptiness and he always recollects the events of the day when he is alone, especially just before he goes to sleep. One day he moves to a place called Enoshima. It is a fishing harbor. He encounters Haru, who starts living with them and other interesting people who he becomes close friends with. As time passes, he begins to enjoy fishing and becomes a totally different person...






**My review**
**
**I especially enjoyed this because I really love 'slice of life' content. Tsuritama is brimming with that. I liked the  overall feel of the anime. It is slow paced, eventful and it is worth mentioning that if you are into fishing, this is a treat! There is also a lot of technical details about fishing, hence the 'Sci-fi' genre. Oh right, one thing that I observed was that there exists plenty of dramatic irony. I mean the anime characters don't laugh about some spastic joke in the anime itself. There are a few instances like the Duck symbolic dance, or whatever they call it; that's funny actually, but none of the characters ever laugh.

**Story**: Sometimes I wish that if the supernatural stuff like the aliens did not exist, the anime would have been much better. If it was only a slice of life anime with Yuki learning how to fish and finding friends, it would have been one of the the best anime. Well anyway, that's just my opinion. Story-wise, Tsuritama is a bit dull in the beginning. But as the story progresses, it gets more fun but I got a queer feeling while watching it. So I'll give this 8/10.

**Art**: It's different from other anime I've watched. The sky lacks detail. I doubt they made it that way because they were feeling lazy, but I suppose that it's an 'artistic' lack of detail. Not bad, but adds to the dullness. Characters and the animation is good, nothing special though. Right, the fishing gear is well done. One thing about the art is that in some scenes, there is an overdose of colour. I recall the flowers kept in the porch of Yuki's house, they are of different colours. There are many scenes with such superfluous use of colour. It's not that I don't like those colours, it's just that all of them together doesn't look very good. But it's not something that'll ruin your day or anything. Just something I think that could have been different. Again a 8/10.

**Characters**: One thing about this 12 episode anime is that, each and every character has been developed to their extent. Now that I think about it, that is a well planned feat. All characters have a right side and a wrong side, and as the anime progresses, they improve themselves with the help of the people around them. The fact is that regardless of how the story is, the characters help make the anime complete. I got a great sense of satisfaction at the end, I owe that feeling to the climax too! Everyone is just so friendly. Enemies later become friends. Friends become best-friends. Everyone accepts one another. Oh yes, one aspect that made a lot of difference was that everyone is selfless. It brings about the cozy feeling of trust, it added to the pleasant feel of the show. This gets nothing less than a 10/10.

**Overall Rating**: 8/10
