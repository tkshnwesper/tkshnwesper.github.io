This review had been pending for several months now, I watched Haikyuu!! S2 before my finals, and then my vacations had a lot of hustling, but now as I can sit on my swiveling computer chair and relax it might be a good time to pen down my thoughts on this anime.

Haikyuu!! is clearly a unique anime, because there's no anime that's as good as this! S1 was a smash-hit already, then the creators had to come up with the second season, which was a continuation of the first and when I thought S1 was as good as it gets, S2 surpassed my expectations! You might have guessed, it has become my favorite sports anime series.

So this time, I.G decided to spice things up by changing the mostly male demographic by adding _one _more female. Hurrah for the improv. But in any case, not like there were hints of romance. OK, maybe yes. Wait, lemme think... What?! No! You call that romance!

So yeah, Haikyuu!! S2 mostly has romance in it, more than volleyball. Yachi-san becomes Hinata's love of life, he quits volleyball, gets married to her, and THE END!

Watch the anime, if you haven't yet ;)
