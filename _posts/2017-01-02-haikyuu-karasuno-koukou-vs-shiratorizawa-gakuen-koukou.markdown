Probably not worth writing a review for, because it was too dull for me. Lost interest in the series, because I guess that I finally realized how repetitive it had become, and it was a complete turn off for me. Not the OP however!! The OP was probably the only reason for me to watch the show.

After 2 brilliant seasons of 'dandiya', I was anticipating that the third one might score once again in the creativity department. How wrong I was. There's practically no reason for anyone (especially if you enjoyed the first 2 seasons) to watch this. Okay, here comes a spoiler: Karasuno wins. Happy now? I am surprised, that although I enjoyed the first 2 seasons so much because of the new combos and strategies that both teams were coming up with to defeat one another at all costs. Season 3 offered nothing new, no new combos or anything, just that the man of the match this time was Tsukishima. Just imagine how boring it must have been it was only 10 epis long but it made me feel way more bored than the previous other seasons. To be honest, the previous 2 seasons were not boring at all!!

And surprise, surprise! It is in the top 10 on MAL. Which just goes to show (in my case) that the popular choice of the public and my choice intersect at around 80%. Meaning, I do not agree with the popular choice of around 20% of anime.

I think that after this, I have lost the Haikyuu!! fever. But I shall come back to listen to the OP since, in all three seasons the OPs have blown my mind and I listen to them even today!!
