Usually, a lot of things in life are based on actions and consequences. When you act on something you can somewhat (if not fully) expect what the consequences will be. This theory has way too many variables in games like LoL where prediction on whether you will be the victor or loser depends on a multitude of configurations, players, their states of mind, their alertness, knowledge of the game, reflexes just to name a few. Non-scientifically you could even say these games are equivalent to gambling! That's how unpredictable they are.

Victory depends not only on you but also on how your team plays, but at the same time without you your team will lose. It depends on the enemy team as well, and each and every player contributes to their team's fate.

"Mayhaps this is a game of luck, like battleship", you might say, but think about the hours of practice and the experience people have gained in order to control the turn of events in the game! It's like reliving a war every time. There's a Japanese saying which goes like, "A war is won before it is fought". Mayhaps wars are inevitable, and mayhaps people are forced to join it even if it's against their will. Mayhaps even the above quote is more intuitive than it seems.

But we don't know unless we play :3
