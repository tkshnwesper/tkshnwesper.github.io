A really random poem started off
by my friend and we kept adding new lines.

She napped like a sprog,
Gorged herself on dinner like a hog.
And now that her tummy was full,
She crashed out like a log.

The following morning,
She jumped off her bed like a frog,
Groaned at the week’s backlog,
And went out for a morning jog.

Later she waded through the dense smog like a polliwog,
Where she got distracted by a hotdog.
Losing balance she fell on a bog,
And shook hands with a hedgehog.
Staggering to her feet,
She glanced at her analog.

Realized that it was late,
She took to her heels,
And reached home all agog,
To see the collab on her pal’s blog!
