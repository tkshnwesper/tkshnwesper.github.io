You can undo your YouTube strikes on your account. One obvious way of getting rid of them is to create a new account using a different email id. But, you can also remove them from the account without using a different email id. There are four steps to achieve this:  


  1. Backup all your existing videos.
  2. Unlink your YouTube account and your Google account.
  3. Close your YouTube account.
  4. Sign up on YouTube using the same email Id as that of the account you just deleted.
