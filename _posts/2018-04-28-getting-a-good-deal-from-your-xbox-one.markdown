I recently purchased an Xbox One X, mostly because it is supposed to be the most powerful console in the world (at the time of writing) and also because I thought the Xbox Live Gold deals seemed pretty good. As you might have already figured, I haven't owned an Xbox before. Neither have I owned any other console for that matter. So I suppose I feel a little satisfaction at getting the most powerful console as my first console.

Well anyway, as I said I really liked the Xbox Gold deals. The part that I thought was really good was that you could play Xbox 360 games on an Xbox One. Also, the fact that I'd be getting 4 games a month with Gold. Little did I know that I had to download the Xbox 360 games on a Xbox 360! So when my subscription started, I was able to download the two Xbox One games but not the two Xbox 360 games. I really don't know the point of this, but yeah it's nothing short of silly.

I somehow got the intuition to contact customer support and ask them about this. Thankfully, I got a great response and a solution to my queries. Apparently, you can redeem the two other Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One by physically signing in on an Xbox 360 and then downloading them. Luckily for me, there was an Xbox 360 at my workplace and the rest was easy. But honestly, I searched high and low for this answer and I didn't find anything that would help. Maybe I wasn't looking in the right place. The Xbox at my workplace is 4Gb and the game was 12Gb, so I had to plug in an external drive. The download to the drive didn't start however, but the game did get added to my list of games (the purchase was successful). So as long as the space on the drive is more than that of the game, you can purchase it.
