You know when a game is good. When it has a good story, good gameplay, and for most good sound. BFBC2 offers all that, and also makes it really fun to play. I am not the kind of person who would wait for his computer to boot up for 5 minutes only to play a game to shoot up others. But yeah, this game gave me a reason to do just that. It's the best FPS I've played, maybe even the best game so far.

The best part is that it even has this DLC called Vietnam or something like that and it's just absolutely dope. No question about it, the developers who created this have done so with love and zeal. It's so clearly visible. Even its reviews are fantastic on Steam at least. You'd be surprised to know that there is a multiplayer mode in that Vietnam DLC which works even in 2018. Like holy crap. DICE! I'm not sure many people still play that game, but I'd say that it's totally worth every penny, and now you could get it for a huge discount every now and then.

What can I say, it's definitely something that would set a standard in the gaming industry, and as a gamer that is something that I am proud of.
