I've finally brought back my blog to life, and this time it's not going to disappear in the foreseeable future. I'm so glad! I've always been the kind of person to boot up a VPS to power my blog, but I felt that the whole VPS act was going under-utilized. Not only did it cost a not-so-insignificant amount of money, but nowadays I do not find time to maintain it anyway. So I decided to ditch it altogether!

I found a great tool to help me with the migration from my good ol' Wordpress blog to Github Pages. Though it's archived on Github, it's been a real ease to use, and not to mention it does a great job (even takes care of all the images)! If you want to migrate too, you could read the instructions from [here](https://github.com/some-programs/exitwp).

As you can see, I've also configured a custom domain with it. After using Jekyll I'd say static pages are the way to go as far as blogs are concerned. You might have remembered one of my past articles on [Jekyll](https://saurabh.machave.in/news/2019/01/28/rejuvenated-with-jekyll.html). So you might be wondering, how did I switch to Jekyll twice?! Well, it's more like, I had a Wordpress blog back in the days and at one point I decided to write Tech articles in a separate blog here on Github. It was even named Te-x-Plorer or something jazzy like that.

Now, I have simply merged the two blogs, so the order in which articles from both of them appear in the feed might be interleaved. (But really, that's intentional!)

I've decided not to add any tracking, or monetization to this blog. I want it to be a place free of distractions and creepy Javascript code that prods and probes into one's personal life. Also, can't wait for Github pages to start accepting v3 of minima so that I can finally enable the dark theme ðŸ¤©

Feels so good to be back to writing!
