One day before my mid semester examination.

Well, it wasn't my first game to be completely honest here, because on my actual first time my PC crashed and by the time I had reconnected I got an abandon. I cannot blame Steam for this. Just this new modem (I have no clue what the hell is wrong with it). So, I played a Single Draft match with Axe (my first time) and we won! What luck that is huh. Axe has a pretty lousy ult btw. It doesn't do any real damage from what I saw [**update**: now I know how to play him]. The only good thing about him is that he's kinda tanky like all the male characters in dota (and also that he can deal more damage when he's alone). So anyway, we won that match somehow (I forgot to mention we had a broodmother whose user was at level 52! Yeah, after that match I decided that I had to play Spectre again because I didn't get to test her out fully the last time (if you count that).

This time the enemy team her strong picks like Juggernaut (god knows why he's picked in every match), Sven (goddamit this guy!), Huskar (Mista Gank), Naga (she was total noob and fed like anything), and somebody else (I forgot). We had myself (Spectre), Templar Assassin (girls get to have all the fun), Phantom Assassin (the girl who I first thought was a guy), Venomancer (amiable support) and of course Sniper (apparently the character everyone hates). I assisted in getting first blood I think. Spectre does good damage with her Q initially. Out team had less conventional picks unless you want to include PA with her 'blur' evasiveness.

In any case, I took the bottom lane with Venomancer and he was a really helpful support. I remembered the last hero of the enemy team: Spirit Breaker (damn those stuns!). The thing was that most of the time the whole (at least 3-4) heroes of the enemy team would suddenly appear and gank. Lots of times Sven killed me. I fed quite a bit in the beginning and hoped that the rest of my team was doing well in absence of the enemy heroes in their respective lanes. Funnily enough it played out quite exactly like that. The got plenty of farm and one tier-3 tower of top lane also fell. I believe PA was top. Either her or sniper. Once I got my ult, I could teleport to any team fight that I chose and we started winning team fights. Not only because of me, PA, TA were playing great too. But I got the highest number of kill assists: 29. I thought this match would be cutting it close, but I was wrong. We won pretty easily. I usually feed a lot in the beginning. But as the game progresses I start getting kills and assisting. I got a battle fury first, then Radiance and finally a moon shard which I consumed and then bought another one. What do you basically need? Good damage and attack speed! That's something I learnt playing LoL. Speaking of LoL, it's mechanics are totally different compared to Dota. Which is better I cannot say, but LoL looks to be the one attracting the crowds.
