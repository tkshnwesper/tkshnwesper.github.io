This was my first VN, and I've just played one ending till now. Went with my instincts :D

But I thought it would be good to share a few thoughts about how my first ever VN was. To be frank, this was an quite extraordinary VN (I keep saying VM in my head lol) even for those who are well versed in playing VNs. So, first off I'll tell you how I found out about this game. Through Twitter and Reddit mostly. Saw a couple of posts relating to it, and especially one which was a picture from Twitch that showed that DDLC had more viewers than DotA 2 (I find that surprising no more, sorry DotA folks!). Well, anyway it just took one search to find that game on Steam and add it to my library. I hadn't played it for a week or so, it was just sitting idly in my library. But I have this friend who was playing it and recommended it to me. So I was like, "Okay, let's give it a shot."

I won't give away any spoilers other than the fact that it's a psychological horror game (I didn't know that when I started playing). Take the warning on the loading screen seriously if you are a sensitive person. Jokes aside, the story is about four cute girls and is essentially a dating sim. You are supposed to understand the personalities of all the girls and pick words that match their personality. Based on the highest number of words you pick for the girl that you want, the story changes and takes different routes.

It was definitely more fun than what it was worth (it's free). I am going to support the developer (Team Salvato) for this amazing game. From a reviewer's point of view, it could be said that the narration and dialogues were very well written. Just enjoy it! It's worth playing, and recommending to friends :)
