Dang! I haven't posted in a long time, I've had my hands full with a lot of things. But a couple of interesting things happened along the way, for instance I watched the new Spider-Man animated movie <3







Looks might get a little deceiving with this one, the trailer is rad, have no doubt. But the movie got screened in the "Play House" section at my local theatre, and made me consider whether it was really only for kids or all kinds of audience. My skepticism had to eat crows, for the movie was way better than expected (well, actually I knew it had a great rating), but I would really say that this title is going to be remembered as one of the great animated movies ever created.







I should say that I am quite lucky to have watched this rare gem, I mean I went to watch it alone and came back to tell my friends how good it was. One of the best things about this movie was the unexpectedly great comedy that had the whole audience rolling on the floor with laughter. Then there was the childlike innocence that it came bundled with. The jokes didn't contain any dark humor or anything, because let's admit it, it was a kids movie. Just kidding!
