Debian was getting a bit rusty to work with, so I decided to install an operating system which had a large community backing and latest software updates. Ubuntu seemed to be the best answer. I've used Ubuntu before, but it didn't impress me as much as Debian had done the first time I used it. Debian has an unique quality of clicking with the user's wishes, and everything just falls into place once you become well acquainted with the commands. Ubuntu is basically Debian with an attempt to have a more user friendly interface. They have done a good job no doubt, but a few bugs keep popping every now and then in the GUI. I felt it better to stick to the terminal. I guess, that goes for any Linux distro. Ubuntu can become an exciting development platform for me, which is the main reason why I chose it. Debian lacked latest updates, and self-updating packages like the android SDK required newer versions of the IDE. When I went to bring Eclipse up to date, it stopped working at all. Not that I was surprised. If I updated just one package to it's latest version, it is natural to update all it's dependencies as well. But that solution would have costed me a lot of time and bandwidth. So I went for a permanent solution of installing an OS with relatively new packages. Bam! Ubuntu!
