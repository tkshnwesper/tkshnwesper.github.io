A friend of mine was making a forum RPG game, and he asked me if I wanted to make the game with him. I accepted. At first, we were planning to have only a banner to tell people that a game was going to be launched. So, we decided what to write on the banner. But later I realized, it would be really cool if we could make a video. So I made one. We were in a little hurry to publish it, so I couldn't sync the audio with the video. But a few days later I updated it.
