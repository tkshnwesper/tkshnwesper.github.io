What makes a strong mind strong? It might be apparent to you that strong minded people are the ones who become really successful in life. How does one create or develop their minds to become strong?

I found this helpful article on the in a simple Google search. They make some incredibly valid points. Meditation especially does a huge help for your mind. It is as they say in the article,


<blockquote>If you want a stronger mind, you can achieve it with some work and patience, just like you would train your body in a gym.</blockquote>


This fact is absolutely true. Even your mind requires exercise just like your body does, and it is meditation that entails these benefits into your life. Meditation is _simple_. All you have to do is focus, concentrate on something. One of the ways I do it is by visualizing a burning candle without losing focus. Your concentration needs to be so good such that it feels as though you are staring at a candle in real life without blinking. So, not even once do you divert your attention to other thoughts or sounds. All this with your eyes closed, obviously. It might sound simple at first, but it's really really difficult to accomplish. It will take a few days to get better at it.

I have discovered while experimenting with myself, that diving into such states of meditation is linked to how much betterment you want to do to yourself, because meditation is naturally linked to _your_ body's mind.

Another practice of creating a strong mind is again very rightly stated by the earlier blog.


<blockquote>Develop your mental toughness by knowing what you believe, having the conviction to live by your values, and becoming resilient enough to recover from adversity.</blockquote>


This is the part where you have to show the courage to change, once your mind is able to sort out through thoughts and an orderly fashion (thanks to the meditation), it's time to take the controls in your hands (or in your mind's hands) and steer the vehicle in what which way that you desire it to go.

I know that sounds abstract, but the gist is that you must have the willingness to become a much better person, only then can that willingness drive you to make the right decisions and choose the right words in your life. A Positive Mental Attitude is something that needs to be forced into your thoughts for a while until your mind subconsciously starts using that approach.

It's easy, requires a little work, but certainly possible by anybody.
