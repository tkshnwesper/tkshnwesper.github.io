Shokugeki noSouma was another popular anime of 2015, and it justified its popularity by giving a great viewer experience in those 24 episodes filled with foodgasms, and exaggeration beyond safe levels. But it was an entertaining show that I thought would finish by the end of 2 cours but apparently dragged on with its own pacing.

The pacing was quite perfect for a slow show like SnS where there was a lot of stress on the drama and focus on the food itself. Though they did not delve into the fine makings of recipes, I hope people well versed with culinary knowledge will be able to pick up bits of cooking wisdom that it offered.

Like most anime there was love rivalry of some sort, and although the romance is bleak, it is certain that there will be a romance plot in the near future. The story played out well with the characters, and the character developments were done decently as well with generous attention given to the hero of this anime: Food.

It may be hard to believe that even after 24 episodes, the anime progressed only so much. It has a gradual feel to it with small arcs branching out from the storyline and merging back in without much disruption to the original story. The character development is satisfying yet sluggish, where the characters that need development are properly developed, yet I felt the need for additional information of all of the characters. That can be attributed to the writers wit, without doubt.

The so called antagonist Nakiri Erina is a tsundere at first glance but reveals her soft side as the anime progresses, typical of tsunderes. She is one of the major characters who require development. The arcs are so entwined so gracefully that you will feel like they are part of the main story. Even though the story hasn't progressed much, they managed to deliver a successful 2 cour show without getting me bored.

The gems of this show are his mates in his Polar dormitory. That's where the family type feeling reels up on this show. The kernels of love and much of the time in episodes goes in that. I would look forward to the next season of SnS,Â confident that I won't be disappointed.
